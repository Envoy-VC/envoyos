    intro: `
I'm Vedant, a developer and technical writer obsessed with building things that matter. For the past three years, I've been deep in the Web3 space, shipping products that push boundaries, attending IRL events, and diving into hackathons where ideas turn into deploys.
Currently, I'm focused on building a secure Battleship game on the Nillion Network, blending cryptography, game mechanics, and user experience into something both fun and resilient.`,
    other: `I'm thinking about the next challenge, idea, or innovation. Perfectionism drives me to explore smarter solutions and refine every detail.
I'm obsessed with Silicon Valley reruns, love gaming, and spend most of my time reading technical content. I also love traveling, always curious to explore new places, people, and technologies that inspire what's next.`,

  vision: {
    answer: `For me, building in Web3 is about creating systems that people actually own and control. I thrive in the spaces where tech moves quickly, ideas are radical, and progress isn't optional. Web3 gives me a sandbox to experiment, ship, and iterate building systems that actually accelerate the pace of change.`,
    statement: `Sometimes the best way to solve a problem is to build something completely new.`,
